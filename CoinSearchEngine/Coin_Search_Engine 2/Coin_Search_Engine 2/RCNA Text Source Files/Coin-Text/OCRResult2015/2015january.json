            "Welcome to your first copy of the CN Journal in its\nnew format.",
            "I talked in the December issue about the\nchallenges we had faced, and that we had decided to make\na few changes to the format. This month's issue was chosen\nfor the change, because we know many of our members\nlike to keep their copies, often in a binder sorted by year, so\nthe start of a new year was the best time.",
            "The idea of changing to this format has been discussed\non and off for a number of years, and I think it is a definite\nmove forward. The larger pages will give the editor a bit\nmore room for design, and I think you will find the result\nmuch more pleasing. The change also allows a bit more\ncontent, and I'm sure that Henry will be more than happy\nto accept new submissions. I'm just as sure that he will be\nopen to some constructive criticism. It is human nature to\nbe a bit suspicious of change, so I hope you will allow us\na few issues in order to give the new format a fair chance.",
            "As we mentioned in the previous column, we have\nreduced the number of issues, but I think the member will\nstill get more bang for the buck.",
            "A few other things I would like to address at this time are\ndirectly or indirectly connected to our annual convention,\nbeing held July 22-25, 2015, in Halifax.",
            "Most pressing is the need to get nominations in for the\nRCNA board. This is an election year, which means that we\nwill be looking to bring in a new board. Now I'm not being\ncritical of any of our existing members. I'm just saying that\nif someone wants to put his or her name forward, now ts the\ntime. So far, I have been approached by one individual who\nhas expressed a willingness to stand for election for the first\ntime, that's always encouraging and I hope to see more.",
            "Talk of the convention reminds me that it is just a few\nmonths away, and now is a good time to start making\nplans to head out to Halifax for a few days of numismatic\nfellowship.",
            "I had the good fortune to be in Halifax in 2014 on\nbusiness and can tell you that the city has a lot to offer the\ntourist. While I was there I took a few minutes to check out\nthe convention hotel, the Westin Nova Scotian. Its location,\nright on the harbour and next to Pier 21, is excellent. There\nare literally dozens of interesting restaurants, pubs, and\nboutiques within a short walk, and plenty of history and\ninteresting architecture. I also looked through the hotel\nand it's full of all the glamour that you would expect from\na railway hotel built in the 1920s. It was renovated not too\nmany years ago, and it was done with taste and elegance.\nBourse, meetings, and the auction will all take place on the\nsame floor, a rare convenience.",

Considering\neverything, it is my opinion\nthat the war has been a\nmost successful one, and\nhighly honourable to the\nBritish arms; ... you have\nnot been able to carry it\ninto the enemy's territory,\nnotwithstanding your\nmilitary success, and now\nundoubted military superiority,\nand have not even cleared your\nown territory of the enemy...\nHe continued:\nIf you had territory, as I hope you\nsoon will have New Orleans, I\nshould prefer to insist upon the\ncession of that province as a\nseparate article than upon the uti\npossidetis [retain possession of\nwhat they have acquired by force\nduring the war].\nHere Wellington was referring to the\nother active British campaign, still in\nprogress during the talks, involving\nthe invasion of the Louisiana Territory,\nland originally belonging to Spain,\nwhich Napoleon Bonaparte sold to the\nUnited States in 1803 to help fund the\nwar with Britain. In the spring of 1814\nAdmiral Alexander Cochrane had\nbeen ordered to assemble an invasion\nforce in Montego Bay, Jamaica, with\nthe purpose of taking New Orleans.\nThere he amassed over 80 ships and\n14,000 soldiers in addition to the 3,500\nsailors already under his command.",

            "by Robert W. McLachlan in 1886. Both of these numismatic\npioneers have told us that the variety 2 medal, which they\nsuccessively owned, was the only one they had ever seen.\nEach cataloguer used his own medal numbering\nscheme and none except Sandham called the medal the\nCommemorative Medal. Throughout this article, therefore,\nfor purposes of clarity, we shall use the terminology\nSandham first used in 1871, 1.e.,  Commemorative\nMedal,  and  varieties 1, 2, and 3. \nLest the present article add to the confusion rather than\nclarify matters, let me now mention another medal which\nis closely related to the Commemorative Medal. It was\ncontemporary and, in fact, shares the same obverse as the\nmedal seen in Figure 2. It is identical in size and, although\nalso struck in silver and bronze, it is most commonly seen\nin white metal. Sandham called it the Bridge Medal in\nhis 1871 work (see Figure 3). He explains that the idea\nof a medal with the reverse showing the Victoria Bridge\ncame from Messrs. Savage & Lyman, the Montreal firm\nthat acted as agent for distribution of the Commemorative\nMedal in Canada East. That firm suggested that since the\nofficial reason for the Prince s visit was to inaugurate the\nsensational new bridge it would be well to mention it on a\nsouvenir medal. The Birmingham manufacturer complied.\nApparently this medal sold well as McLachlan rates its\nrarity as  common  and he also tells us that some 15 years\nafter the Prince s visit there were still 600 left over (which\nultimately were sold to a single purchaser) (McLachlan\n1886: 35). The Bridge Medal is mentioned here, and images\nare provided because, as we shall see, it is referenced in\nthe descriptions by some cataloguers when describing the\nCommemorative Medal. For the sake of clarity, we shall\ncall it the Bridge Medal throughout this article.\nIt is helpful first to review\nhow numismatists\nof the past have\ncatalogued the 1860\nCommemorative",

As a young\nman of twenty-two living in the Eastern Townships, near\nMontreal, at the time of the royal visit, he would most\ncertainly have followed it with great interest, and no doubt\nwitnessed some of the events. He was then in Montreal\nfor most of the two decades following the Prince s\ntour, a period during which his interests in history and\nnumismatics blossomed. He would have been in a good\nposition to know firsthand about, and to collect, medals\nassociated with the Canadian part of the royal visit.

In this first\nrecord of what he later called the Commemorative Medal,\nSandham makes no mention of there being different\nvarieties. It is presumed he may not have discovered\nthem at this point. It is noteworthy that Sandham gives an\ninaccurate size (diameter) for the medal in this listing. He\nuses the old American Scale of one-sixteenth of an inch,\nwhereby each sixteenth inch of diameter represents one\npoint. Thus, we are told that this medal has a diameter of\n26 sixteenths of an inch, 1.e., 1 5/8 inches, or 41.27 mm.\nIn fact, the medal diameter is 43.6 mm. The size Sandham\ngives is nearly 1.5 points too low. The correct size on the\nAmerican scale is thus 27, not 26.",

            "As an aside, Leroux provides a bewildering description\nof the related Bridge Medal, his no. 642. Firstly, the\nobverse he illustrates is not the obverse of the Bridge\nMedal. It has Roman lettering (serif) and the Prince has\nno moustache. It is the obverse of the Commemorative\nMedal, variety 3. The correct obverse is as shown in\nFigure 3. Moreover, Leroux gives the Bridge Medal a\nRarity 4 and he tells us:  There are varieties with and\nwithout the moustache.  Neither of these statements is\ncorrect. McLachlan tells us, providing details, that the\nBridge Medal is common. Nowhere in any of the literature\nI have seen is there any other reference to the Bridge\nMedal having obverse varieties. Nor have I found any\nvarieties of such medals in my enquiries or amongst the\nexamples I have studied.",

Struck in white metal, it\nbears on the obverse a military bust of the Prince,\nand on the reverse an eight line inscription within\na wreath. At least two different varieties exist. The\nmore common of the two depicts the Prince with a\nmoustache, and has a legend in sans serif letters. A\nsecond obverse die using roman letters and portraying\nthe Prince without moustache and in much higher\nrelief was used to strike a quantity of medals which\nwere imported by JE.

Despite the frequency with which a sans serif,\nno moustache medal has been reported, all examples so\nfar examined and noted in catalogues with plates have\nbeen of the moustache variety (Miller 1994: 106).",

He\nmakes no mention of varieties and tells us only that the\nmedal is in white metal, has a diameter of 44 mm, and is\n RR,  1.e., very rare.

If it does exist, it may be a pattern or trial\nstrike, with a decision to add a moustache after work\non the dies began. The Prince seems to have started\ndisplaying facial hair about this time, and that may\nhave had something to do with the two versions. It is\ndifficult to tell from old photos and woodcuts if there is\na light moustache or a shadow. Unless both versions\ncould be examined, I would think the lower relief\nwithout moustache is a trial struck from unfinished\ndies, or a rare strike prior to altering completed dies.",

The Chateau Ramezay\narchivist reported that the museum\ncollection has all three varieties of the\nCommemorative Medal! Through the\ngenerosity of the Chateau Ramezay s\nChristine Brisson, I was provided with\nhigh-resolution images of what most\ncertainly seems to be McLachlan s\n(and before that, Sandham s) variety 2\nmedal, which I am delighted to include\nbelow.

As well, there is a stray wisp of\nhair on the Prince s left in Figure\n9 that is not there in Figure 7.\nNote also the difference in\nseparation between the chin\nand the collar. The most\nstriking difference is that the\nFigure 9 portrait has either\nno moustache or certainly a\nmuch shorter and less distinct\none. Without examining the\nactual medal, I find it a bit\ndifficult to tell.

Instead, however, we\nsee a medal that has clearly seen some\nwear and tear, not to mention that it has\na hole for a suspension ring (and perhaps\nat one time it was worn suspended from\na ribbon). It seems possible that this\nmedal might have been worn by someone\nduring one of the many processions that\nwere part of the Prince s visit, perhaps in\nMontreal. We are left to speculate about\nwhy it exists, and why it is seemingly\nunique. Was it possibly received by,\nsay, Messrs. Savage & Lyman from the\nBirmingham manufacturer as an initial\nspecimen sent on approval and then\nactually worn by one of them during the\nPrince s visit? Then, was it offered to\nSandham as an interesting collectible?\nDid Sandham himself acquire it and wear\nit? If that were the case, it is curious that\nhe would have done so knowing this type\nwas so rare. We may never know unless\nother examples come to light that can tell\nus more. Are there others?",

            "and another dedicated nickel-dollar collector for almost three\nyears after we learned about this variety back in January of 2012.\nA sharp-eyed collector from Omemee, Ontario first spotted",
            "a different 1969 business-strike nickel dollar, with shorter\nwater lines at the stern of the voyageur s canoe, and very\nweak designer initials (Figure 1). This collector reported his\nfind in the Canadian Forum on the Coin Community Family\n(CCF) Web site. I was not able to get in contact with the\ncollector who found this variety, so could not acquire higher\nresolution photographs of his discovery coin. However, I\ndecided that it was important enough to be in the nickel\ndollar variety section of the Charlton Standard Catalogue\nof Canadian Coins 2013, 67\" Edition (Cross, 2013) where\nit appears as CH#1969 Rev-002. Although, without a picture",
            "or an example, the description by the publisher assumes the polishing, similar to the 1968 nickel dollar small island and no",
            "variety to be a die polishing variant. Closer examination of the\nwater lines, demonstrates that this variety is the result of die",
            "island varieties, and the 1977 short water lines variety (Figure\n2). Since being documented in the 67\" edition of the Charlton\nCatalogue, a couple of dedicated nickel dollar\ncollectors have searched thousands of 1969\ndated dollars. One 1969 example was recently\nfound at a coin show in Boucherville, Quebec,\nand three others were found in a bulk lot\npurchased at the fall 2014 Toronto Coin Expo.\nFor many years, collectors have scrutinized\nthe series of nickel dollars. Given the relative\nscarcity of this 1969 variety, I suspect that to\nstrike this variety only one refurbished or over-\npolished working die was used. This variety will\nbe a tougher one to find, but it is one that should\ncost you very little when you do find it in the\nwild, so grab your loupe and keep up the hunt!",

            "ERROR OF THE MONTH",
            "BY HENRY NIENHUIS","FRCNA,FCNRS,FONA LM#430",
            "An interesting mated pair...",
            "Our error coin this month is actually a very",
            "interesting example consisting of a mated pair of",
            "two separate planchets struck together to form a\ncompound 1980 Canadian 1-cent piece. A mated pair, such\nas this error, occurs when two planchets are mistakenly fed\ninto the striking chamber of the coining press at the same\ntime and are struck together.",
            "Mated pair errors are extremely hard to find. Usually\nthe two components are separated after being struck and\nare seldom put back together again. Also equally rare,\nare examples of fused pairs, in which the two planchets\nbecame fused together when struck.",
            "When found, mated pairs always offer their own distinctive\nexample of how the metal of the two planchets flowed together\nduring the immense pressure that the coining press applied.",
            "The images to the right are of the two planchets together,\nas struck. The first feature of this pair to note, is that the upper\nplanchet showing the reverse design, is well centred and has\nbeen clearly broad-struck. This means that it was struck without\nthe support or the constraint of the collar. We can see the trails\nleft by the beading when the metal was squeezed radially\noutward, dishing upward as it flowed. Also, the lower planchet\ncan be seen extending past the upper planchet, offset by roughly\n1 mm, in the direction of 6:00 (shown by the arrow.)",
            "The abrasion marks visible near the edge above both\n3:00 and 9:00 occurred sometime after the strike and are not\nimportant to the discussion.",
            "The lower image shows how the two planchets fit\ntogether. Looking at the 12:00 position we can see a portion\nof the upper planchet protruding about 2 mm beyond the\nobverse rim of the lower planchet. Looking closely, you\nwill also see the characteristic railway-wheel shape around\nthe edge of the conjoined planchets. This deformity curves\nupward from the edge of the obverse surface. It looks very\nsimilar to what you might see when looking at the bottom\nof a plate. This shape resulted when metal partially flowed\nover the collar because the thickness of the two stacked\nplanchets exceeded the collar s height, forcing metal to\nsqueeze out when the dies came together.",
            "The images on the next page show enlargements of both\nsides of the two separated planchets. The top images are\n(left to right) the blank obverse / struck reverse of the upper-\nmated coin. The bottom images show the struck obverse\n/ blank reverse of the lower-mated coin. The distinctive\nfeature on the blank obverse of the upper coin and the blank\nreverse of the lower one is the characteristic orange-peel-like\nsurface, which we see on the majority of mated pairs. This\nfeature is expected because the two surfaces were in contact\nwhen under pressure together during the strike.",

            "The other characteristic of these two surfaces is the faint\nbut clearly visible ghost image of the Queen's effigy. In the\nupper coin the effigy is facing right while in the lower coin it\nfaces left; again as expected. This ghost image was caused by\nthe metal of both planchets flowing into the obverse (anvil)\ndie. Why is the metal flowing more towards the obverse than\nit does towards the reverse, you may be asking? The answer\nto that is tied to a further feature of this particular mated pair,\nwhich makes it even more unusual.",
            "January + February 2015 ----------------------------",
            "The two planchets are not of the same weight. The upper\nplanchet is the full 2.80 g specified for the 1980 1-cent coin.\nThe lower planchet is significantly underweight at only\n1.10 g. Because the two planchets were roughly the same\ndiameter (we know this from the comparable sizes after strike)\nwe can calculate that the lower planchet was approximately\n0.5 mm thick before being struck. The upper planchet was\nover twice that thickness and when the conjoined planchets\nwere forced into the incuse features of the dies, the upper\n"

            "planchet contributed metal towards the anvil die while the\nlower planchet did not contribute any the hammer die. If both\nplanchets were the same thickness then both would have\ncontributed equally and there would have been a ghosted\nimage, consisting of aspects of both the Queen's effigy and the\nmaple twig, on the blank inside surface of both coins.",
            "The question that remains is, what is the lower planchet\nand where did it come from? Likely there are two possible\nanswers to this. It could be a foreign planchet that was un-\nnoticed or it could be a remnant of a planchet that split prior\nto being struck, splits may occur in the upset mill. A review\nof the foreign coins produced at the RCM in 1980 does not\nreveal any potential possibilities. The Mint's closest candidate\nwould be 18 mm in diameter, but of 2.05 g weight, stock\nintended for the New Zealand 1-cent piece. If you think about\nit, itis hard to imagine a coin issued for circulation that would\nbe 19 mm in diameter and only 0.5 mm thick.",
            "This then leads us to the next possibility, the split planchet.\nClose examination of the surfaces of the lower planchet does\nnot reveal any conclusive artifacts that would point to it\nbeing a portion of a split planchet. In particular what we\nwere looking for are the deep linear striations produced when\nthe metal strip is cold rolled to the appropriate thickness.\nThese marks are usually present if the planchet has split\nbefore being struck. Because the planchet is so thin though\nthese marks may have been completely obliterated when",
            "it was struck by the anvil die. There are small artifacts in\nthe surface texture of the unstruck portion of the obverse\nside of the lower planchet below the Queen's effigy at 6:00\nwhich might support the split planchet theory. Although not\nconclusive, these artifacts may be remnants of the linear\nstriations we were expecting.",
            "This somewhat implicit evidence then leans toward the\nlower planchet of our mated-pair being a portion of a full\nplanchet which split during an earlier stage in the minting\nprocess and remained among with the acceptable planchets.\nThis overly thin planchet may have been able to feed into the\npress together with a full sized planchet.",
            "The final characteristic of interest, present on the obverse\nsurface of the upper coin, is the raised crescent-shaped fillet\nof metal produced as the edge of the lower planchet was\nforced into its surface while it was partially confined by the\ncollar. This marks the position of the lower planchet relative\nto the upper planchet. The reverse of the lower planchet has\na somewhat different, indented feature, which demarks the\npoint at which the upper planchet was forced into its surface.\nA curved channel, again at 6:00, resulted when the thinner\nlower planchet was forced up and around the upper planchet\nduring the strike.",

            "Walking around modern Rome for the first\ntime can be one of a traveller's\nmost memorable experiences;",
            "there seems to be a new treasure worth\nexclaiming over in every block. My\nown first walk in the ancient city was\na mere dozen years ago and towards\nthe end of the day, leg weary but full\nof an explorer s zeal, I found myself\nwalking away from the Colosseum\nalong a fairly large street called the\nVia di San Giovanni in Laterano. A\nshort way along I stumbled across the old\nchurch of San Clemente and recalled reading\nan article by my old friend Bruce Brace\nabout Rome s second mint being here.\nThis old building, dedicated to the\nfourth Pope, was a wedding cake\nof historical strata, the lowest level\nbeing a temple to the soldiers  god\nMithras and the slightly older mint\nwhich was opened in the year 82 by\nthe emperor Domitian. A display about\nthis mint awaits today s visitor but was\nnot yet in place on my visit.",
            "In Nummus Matrix 35: A Coin for a Brief\nand Tragic Reign, we saw the short reign of the\nemperor Titus (79-81). His death at the age of only\n42 may have been brought about by three historical\ndisasters: the eruption of Mt. Vesuvius which buried\nthe cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum and incurred\ngreat loss of life, a plague which killed many Romans\nand terrified the whole population and yet another\nGreat Fire in the centre of the city in the year 80.\nThis huge conflagration burned much of the north\nend of the Forum as well as the Temple of Jupiter\non the Capitolium overlooking the Forum. For the\nfourth and final time Rome s main temple needed\nto be rebuilt. Less well known however is that, at\nthe other end of the Capitolium (on a lesser summit\ncalled the Arx), the Temple of Juno Moneta was also\nburned. This temple had, since republican times, been\nRome s main mint and has supplied us with all sorts\nof monetary terms (including that one.)",

            "The precious metal coins of Titus stopped abruptly\nin June of 80 when the fire occurred and only\nresumed in 82 when the new mint down\nhe street opened. This seems to have\nbeen an unprepossessing, utilitarian\nbuilding in contrast with its former\nsetting. Striking most of the coins\nfor the empire was serious business.\nTo mark the occasion, Domitian\n(81-96) struck the first coins bearing\na likeness of Moneta in 82. Reverses\nlike this are personifications. No one\never worshipped the figure of Moneta\nas a goddess as they did, say, Minerva, the\nLatin goddess of wisdom whom Greeks\ncalled Athena. (Juno Moneta of the old\nburned out temple was worshipped as\nhe goddess Juno.  Moneta  was an\nadded title and meant the  watcher \nor  monitor ; later, because the\nmint was there the word  moneta ",
            "became associated with money.).\nThis reverse type became a\nfavourite for the rest of the reign; the as\n( 4 sestertius) shown was struck in 87 and\nit is a common type through his final year, 96.",
            "On the obverse is the emperor wearing the laurel\ncrown, facing right. Around is one of the more\ndetailed inscriptions on a Roman coin, only outdone\nby Trajan s: IMP CAES DOMIT AVG GERM COS\nXII CENS PER PP. (Imperator Caesar Domitianus\nGermanicus Consul XIII Censor Perpetuus Pater\nPatriae). His thirteenth consulship occurred in 87,\ndating the coin. His being perpetual censor gave him\ncontrol over the Senate s membership.",
