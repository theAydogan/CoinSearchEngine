Thereafter, in 2014,\na fortuitous discovery revealed that some of these pieces\nwere used as host coins for the one-twelfth ecu aux Palmes\nrecoinage in 1694 95. Then, from archival sources, we\nlearned that colonial authorities of Qu bec were planning\nto send royal coins back to France to be recoined, at\nthe beginning of a  reformation  process in\nthe 1690s. In this second part, we will take\na closer look at physical characteristics\nof these recoinages, their historical\ncontext, as well as new indications of\ntheir introduction in New France.\nAnd so, twenty-four years after\nbeing minted, our glorious 5 sols\nthen became a 1/12 ecu aux Palmes!\nSome of these obsolete 1670 colonial\npieces, finally ended up as planchets\noverstruck as this 1/12 ecu type, of\nwhich we found four specimens: a 1694\n(D mint), two 1695 (A and T mints), and a\n non-dated  aux Palmes type. Fortunately, for\nthe greater benefit of numismatists today, they\nwere softly restruck, enough to allow the\nidentification of this prized 1670 under-\ntype. Such an important discovery\nclearly confirms the return of some\ncolonial 5 sols pieces to France.\nThis particular series was the second\ntype of five reformation coinages\nissued under Louis XIV from 1690\nto 1705, struck in most French mints\nbetween 1693 and 1701 (extreme\ndates), authorized by the royal edict of\nSeptember 1693. It is a quite rare type,\nmuch more so than the sous marque\nas a comparison. Some of the date-\nmints combinations are extremely\nrare, like the 1695-T (the second of\nonly two specimens known), which was unrecorded until\nrecently and the first one (without the 1670 under-type)\nfound in 2007, then published in the Les Monnaies des\nQuatre Rois Louis (Louis XIII a Louis XVI, 1610-1792)\n2011 edition.

This ordinance refers to the classic\ndomestic crowned shield type of 5 sols that reached\npeak mintage between 1658 and 1664. Although first\nintroduced at a 5 sols rate, its value fluctuated through\ndecades by various decrees and that is why the term\n twelfth ecu  is a more appropriate way to refer to the\ncoin.

This same ordinance was listed by\nShortt in 1925, except that there was a confusion in the\ndate (Sept. 24). This ordinance, following the Royal Edict\nof 1 April 1700, fixed the coin at an equal rate in France\n(Willey, CNJ, 1989, p. 167). Both official documents refer\nto the one and only coin valued as six sols: the 1/12 ecu\naux Palmes, a royal type still in effect and commonly\nused in 1700.

Figuring\nthe French livre at 20 sols, 434 pieces at 5 sols each\nequals 108 livres 10 sols, so the count is good. At that\ntime coins from previous reformations (including the\ntype aux Palmes) would have been part of local coin\naccumulations, because the Quebec authority was less\naffected by recalls of old coin types that would have had\nto be transported back to France for recoining.

            "Now, let s have a closer look at physical characteristics\nof those four specimens of recoined 1670 5 sols. I\npersonally found the first example, a 1694-D from the\nLyon Mint, in early 2014. Fellow numismatist Pierre\nRaymond and I have often noted a  rule  in collecting:\nOnce you find a rare French coin, a second specimen is\nsometimes not too far behind. This may be due to small\nhoards coming to market from detection finds or building\nrestorations, caches occasionally found in good condition,\nin pots, or inside walls of structures. This rule worked again\nfor us. Through diligent searching in 2014 we have now\nlocated the four overstruck 5 sols previously mentioned:\nthe initial 1694-D, a 1695-A, a 1695-T (Paris and Nantes\nmints, respectively) and the fourth from mint A (Paris),\na  non-dated  of Palmes type. All of them with a clear\n1670 under-type date. Despite three different mintmarks,\nall show similar features such as a faint trace of an old\nmore or less straight folding, weaker on the 1695-A, which\nalso shows a slight bend. Only one, the 1695-T, bears other\nunusual small rectangular markings, apparently under the\npatina. Could this be from a mint tool or simply a casual\nalteration? All three dated coins have a similar old natural\npatina, and all appear to be in the same average VF grade\nrange, suggesting a fairly short circulation. The undated\nspecimen has remains of an old patina, partially cleaned\nrecently. Is all this a pure coincidence? Are these coins\nlinked together in some way   as if they were gathered\nat some time, lost or stolen, then hidden and forgotten?\nCould they have originated from a circumstantial small\nfind, which occurs with some frequency when restoring\nold houses? Imagine how many stories these coins could\nreveal, but their part in history will stay secret.",

Our\nrecoined 5 sols Gloriam Regni specimens are quite\nunusual due to the fact that the host coin did not come\nfrom commercial French circulation, but rather was of\na type issued exclusively for America and forbidden\nin France! Would this have made recoining them\nillegal   given an obligation that they be remelted\nrather than restruck? Otherwise, it suggests that the\nintention was to obliterate completely the host type\nvia a  nice overstrike.  The recoined  aux Palmes \nappears to be a good quality strike on both sides,\neven if a part of the original legend is discernible.\nWas this level of obliteration of the host acceptable\nto the mint managers? Maybe not, but if it s  yes, \nthe next question should be: Were these pieces really\nwithdrawn after recoinage? If not, does it mean the\nfold could have been made before recoining? To\ncancel the colonial host type maybe? A relevant\ndetail needs to be considered here; the overstrikes\ncome from different mints, but all were struck over\nthe same colonial  striped  under-type, suggesting a\npossible prior grouping to cancel them, before they\nwould be sent to the mints. When closely examining\nthe coins, it does not seem like they were  folded \nafter the overstrike. Metallic surfaces are smooth\nand show no evident traces of subsequent tooling.",

            "Except from a die strike when recoining. Could\nminting technology at that time really make a partly\nfolded coin perfectly flat, erasing all previous traces?\nSeemingly impossible. These folds really look to be\nmade prior to the coins being restruck.",
            "A recent find tends to confirm this assertion, with the\ndiscovery of a regular 1670 5 sols (not recomed, figure\n2) bearing two clearly visible folds. Are they the result\nof a random coin alteration, or do we have an official\ncancellation done with a mint tool? Could this be the\nprecursor to our  intercontinental coin ? Both creases,\none on the reverse and the other on the obverse, appear to\nbe the result of a strike or punch not from a scratch with\na pointed tool. How would these creases look after an\noverstrike? The obverse one bears two tiny circular marks\npunched over the bust area. Then, if we compare these\ncreases or folds with those on the four recoined specimens,\nthey show interesting similarities. All of them are not\nperfectly straight-lined, but rather very slightly curved.\nFor the five coins, accurate measurements comparing\ntheir folds reveal that the folds vary between 17 and 19\nmm in length and between 5 and 7 mm in distance from\ntheir centre to the coin s edge. The length of folds present\nin the regular 5 sols matches those on two of the recoined\nspecimens: The one on the reverse matches the 1694-D\nfold, the other, on the obverse, matches the non-dated\n1/12 ecu from Paris mint (A). Finally, of the five coins,\nthree have a crease\nbelow the 1670\ndate area. Might\nthese be marks\nfrom repetitive hits\nby some kind of\nmetal chisel used to\ncancel coins? This\nis a question that\nremains open.",
            "After careful examination of the coins, and\nclues given by contemporary documents, can\nwe hypothesize that these  planchet folds  were\nintentionally made before recoinage, between 1690\nand 1694, to cancel the obsolete colonial 1670 type,\nforbidden to be used in France? If this is the case,\nwhere were such deformations made   in Quebec City\nbefore the shipments left New France, at the port of\narrival, or when the coins were delivered to the mints\nin France? Take note here that some colonial 5 sols\npieces were obviously already in France, through\nprevious, and ongoing commercial exchanges since\n1670. This is truly an interesting question; to answer it\nrequires finding documentary evidence... if it exists!",

            "Lord Dufferin, following his concept in Canada of a\nviceregal medal, began a series of Viceroy of India\nMedals, by issuing his when he assumed that post there, in\n1884. The next ten viceroys continued the practice. Author\nRobert Puddester in Medals of British India explains:\nViceroy presentation medals were designed to be a\npersonal award by the Viceroy for\npresentation to deserving  ordinary \npersons most often found among the\nViceroy s own staff, or the staff\nof officials on tour, and among\nthe ranks of the civil service\n  people who had done the\nViceroy or his government\nsome service and who\nshould be recognized for\ntheir long, meritorious,\nfaithful or special service.\nIn contrast to awarding\nGovernor General Medals to\npeople in Canada, Viceroy of\nIndia Medals originally were\nintended for British persons in\nIndia and not for Indian citizens.\nThese medals seldom were engraved,\nevidenced by the fact that the Lansdowne\nmedal of each author was unnamed.\nThe award process later was amended\nsomewhat when Viceroy of India Medals\nbecame available to select members\nof the Indian Army for excellence\nin marksmanship. These were\nusually named on the edge and\nsuspended from a ribbon.\nFor his Viceroy of India\nMedal Dufferin selected a\nnon-portrait style. For its\nobverse he chose the reverse\ndesign from his Canadian\nGovernor General Medal. For\nits reverse he used his arms,\nan Earl s coronet and his orders.\nLansdowne, in a different mindset,\nused the conjoined busts obverse from\nhis Canadian medal for his Viceroy of\nIndia Medal, with a reverse like that\nof the Canadian medal, but with subtle\nchanges. Puddester catalogues the\nLansdowne Viceroy medal as 888.2,\nrated  RR,  being  very rare, less [sic] than 50 specimens. \nLike the Governor General Medals, Viceroy of India\nMedals are approximately 51 mm in diameter and were\nissued in gold, silver, and bronze.",

(Grand Master\nof the Indian Empire) Viceroy of India\nis on the India medal, which includes\nLansdowne s two recent India honours.\nOn the reverses, his arms show telltale\ndifferences: Below the shield, the\nfield with maple leaves indicates\nCanada, whereas the field with\nthe chain of award and its three\nsuspended  orders  denotes\nIndia.

A.\nWyon  was Alan Wyon (1843  \n1907) and clearly, he made the\nViceroy of India Medal. As we\nshall see, it seems likely he was\nalso the creator of the Governor\nGeneral Medal.\nAlan was the son of Benjamin\nWyon and younger brother\nof Joseph Shepherd ( J.S. )\nand Alfred Benjamin ( A.B. )\nWyon. For generations, the Wyons\nhad successively held the office of Chief\nEngraver of Seals   Alan Wyon, his\ntwo brothers before him, their father,\nBenjamin, and their grandfather,\nThomas, all held the post.

Over his fifteen-year tenure,\nLansdowne grew into an experienced British\nGovernment administrator and a member of\nthe House of Lords.

            "Lord Lansdowne, although born into the charmed circle\nof Britain s ruling class, took his noble obligations to\nheart. Eschewing a life of leisure, which was certainly\navailable to him, he pursued a life of long service that\nwas distinguished by both his honourable conduct and\nhis extraordinary abilities. He was a modest, personable,\ngood humoured man, a statesman, and worthy of our\nadmiration. Unlike many other Canadian governors\ngeneral and Indian viceroys of his era, he left these posts to\ncontinue a successful and distinguished career in politics.\nMuch of his public service and its accomplishments\nare the stuff of history; his biographer attests to his\nhumanitarian disposition, and remembrances of these\ncombined aspects of his life are still honoured in public\nmemorials in his name. For those numismatists attracted\nto their nation s history, Lord Lansdowne s viceregal years\nare fittingly commemorated by his Canadian Governor\nGeneral and Viceroy of India Medals.",

            "In 1953, David Edmonds proposed a",
            "new variety of Breton 724, Charlton\nUC-6, the Brock Urn token, which\napparently had been overlooked by\nR.W. McLachlan when he did his\nlisting of the Upper Canada series\nfor the American Numismatic\nSociety in 1916. This variety\nhas appeared in The Charlton\nStandard Catalogue of Canadian\nColonial Tokens since 1988 as\nUC-6A4. Edmonds described this\nnew variety as being similar in all\nrespects to McLachlan s variety no.\n6, except for the following differences\non the obverse:  Bottom of urn curved\nupwards, especially on the right side. The first\nleaf above the hand of left cherub is slightly\noff vertical, leaning towards the head of\nthe cherub. Hand of left cherub shows\na thumb  (1953: 6). Figures 1 and 2.",
            "At the same time as he\ndescribed this new variety of\nBreton 724, Edmonds attempted\nto improve on McLachlan s\nsomewhat abbreviated\ndescription of his no. 6. Edmonds\ndescribed McLachlan s no. 6 as\nhaving a flat bottom to the urn\nwhile, in addition:  Leaf of wreath\njust above hand of left cherub is\nvertical. Hands [sic] shows no thumb \n(1953: 5). This has appeared\nin the Charlton colonial token\ncatalogue as UC-6A3.",
            "However, despite this attention to detail, Edmonds would appear to have been mistaken, both in his description of McLachlan s no. 6",
            "and in his claim of a new variety. The\nplates accompanying McLachlan s\nThe Copper Tokens of Upper Canada\nclearly show his no. 6 with a curved\nbottom to the urn, not a flat bottom\nas Edmonds claims, while the leaf in\nthe cherub s left hand is not vertical.\nSee Figure 3 and the obverse details\nin Figures 4 and 5. In other words,",
            "Edmonds  so-called new variety actually\nfits the appearance of McLachlan no. 6,\nat the same time as his description of\nwhat he takes to be no. 6 is clearly\nin error. The confusion probably\narose because in his written\ndescription of his variety no. 6\nMcLachlan makes no mention\nof the shape of the base of the\nurn or of the leaf held by the\ncherub. Furthermore, his no. 6 is\ndescribed with the least precision\nof any of the varieties, simply as\nfollows:  Obv. Similar to no. 4, but\nthe legs are longer and the two feet\nnot so close. Rev. As no. 5, but the & is\nnearer the E.  Inasmuch as that is all he has to\nsay, it is easy enough to draw one s own\nconclusions. In the absence of the plates\nto supplement McLachlan s written\ndescriptions, that is what Edmonds\nwould appear to have done. Thus,\nin mis-describing McLachlan 6,\nEdmonds inadvertently created\nanew variety out of a real no. 6.\nHe no doubt held a no. 6 in his\nhand as he wrote his description",
            "of this phantom variety.\nCuriously, R.C. Willey\nin cataloguing the tokens of\nUpper Canada in the  The Coins\nof Canada,  in The CN Journal\n(September 1961), appears not\nto have examined McLachlan s\nvarieties with care, and therefore\nhe both follows Edmonds in his",

            "on Canadian tokens over a hundred years ago.",
            "As cataloguers are wont to do, he assigned each\ntoken a number to provide a shortcut for identifying it.\nOver the years, these  Breton numbers  have been used\nby numismatic researchers, written on coin envelopes by\ncollectors, and used by dealers and auctioneers in countless\nprice lists and catalogues. Even as newer token reference\nbooks are published with their own numbering schemes, a\ntable is invariably included to convert to Breton s numbers.",
            "In fact, through his numbering system, Breton had\ncreated a sort of grammar for token collecting. It s the\nfoundational information that collectors need to have to\nunderstand and communicate with their peers.",
            "This may explain why even after more than a hundred\nyears, there is still a demand for Breton s works.\nOriginal copies regularly fetch over a hundred dollars,\nand at least a half-dozen reprints have been published\nover the years.",

            "Breton had started collecting ten years earlier and\nhad already sold his personal collection for a substantial\nprofit. By 1890, he had opened a shop and was making a\nliving as the only coin dealer in Montreal.",
            "The rarity scale in Breton s  new  1894 catalogue is\ndescribed in its preface. It ran from  C  for common\npieces to  R6  for unique pieces. He also thoughtfully\nincluded a rough dollar value for each rarity level.",
            "The obverse and reverse of each token was\nreproduced from well-executed hand-drawings by a\nlocal artist called Georges Bertrand. Accompanying\neach is a number, of course, and a value from Breton s\nrarity scale. Occasionally, he notes  3 other var.  or\nsome other useful fact, but for the most part, there is\nlittle information given for each token.",
            "Over three hundred tokens are listed in all, sorted\nin a way that collectors would recognize from any\nmodern token catalogue   starting with  French\nDomination,  then moving to the different regions of\nearly Canada, and ending with the Dominion.",

            "In 1892, the First Annual Supplement was published. It\nadded another twenty pages of information to the subject.\nBut the titular promise of more supplements was not to be.\nInstead, the success of his original work prompted Breton\nto write a completely new and expansive catalogue.\nThe Illustrated History of Coins and Tokens Relating to\nCanada, published in 1894, would go on to become the\nstandard reference on Canadian tokens and continues to\nbe used to this day.",

These were, in actual fact open air buildings with\nlarge entry doors, steps leading up to them and elaborate\ninterior and exterior decoration. They were shrines\ncontaining an altar dedicated to an ideal, rather than the\naltar itself; (the four main shrines, all seen on coins, were\ndedicated to Providence, Peace, Piety and Health). We have\nalready seen the Ara Pacis Augustae (pictured above in\nthe new Ara Pacis Museum) on an As of Nero in Nummus\nMatrix 15: The Augustan Altar of Peace. Because the Altar\nof Peace is the only one to have survived into our modern\nworld (it was reconstructed from fragments), we can form an\nidea of what the rest may have looked like.",
            "The coin is an As of the emperor Domitian (81-96). He\nwas a member of the Flavian family that began its rule of\nRome with its illustrious patriarch Vespasian (69-79), the\nman who went from country bumpkin to victorious general\n(in Judea, 69-71) and thus to emperor after the brief interlude\nof short-lived emperors following the death of Nero in 68.\nIt was his eldest son Titus (79-81) who was the apple of\nthe old man s eye. It was he who was left behind to mop\nup affairs in the middle east when Vespasian was called\nhome to assume the purple, as the emperorship was known\nand so he did. In 71 Titus was able to return to Rome and\njointly celebrate a triumph with his father. IVDAEA CAPTA\ncoins commemorate this victory, the parade for which can\nstill be seen carved in bold relief under the Arch of Titus,\nthe immense gold menorah from Jerusalem displayed\nprominently to this day.",
            "Domitian, the younger brother and not the one the old man\nturned to, spent a good deal of his time trying to emulate his\nolder and more successful brother. But Titus was plagued by\npoor health and in his short reign as disaster after disaster\npiled up (a huge fire in Rome destroyed the newly completed\nTemple of Jupiter and most of the Forum s north end, plague\nstruck Rome causing havoc and Pompeii and Herculaneum",
            "were buried under the ash and lava of Vesuvius), Titus died of\nnatural causes at the age of 42. Everyone mourned the death\nof one so young who had brought so much glory to Rome and\nhad brought back treasures from the east that they had seen\nthe in the museum at the Forum of Peace.",
            "So now it was the turn of the dour and taciturn younger\nbrother to take the reins of government. Domitian is one of\nthe best arguments in history for a politicians  school. Now\nthat he had power he wielded it. He made himself Censor,\nthen Censor for life resurrecting an old republican title that\nallowed him to name some Senators and bar others. His reign\nwas marked by summary executions usually brought on by\nprotests and dissent. He competed with his late brother by\nissuing coins celebrating his heroic conquest of Germany on\ncoins declaring GERMANIA CAPTA. Appropriating his\nbrother s reputation for his own ends became a way of life\nwhen he openly lived with Titus s daughter as man and wife.",
            "Titus s notoriously bad health caused much concern in the\nmonths before his death and it is likely that the Senate erected\nthe shrine to his health, seen on the As, at that time. In 85,\nperhaps in a bid to cash in on that sympathy, Domitian issued\nthis coin soliciting prayers for the emperor s health: his. Atop\nthe shrine s fa ade are flames from the altar inside and the\nwords SALVTI AVGVSTI, (for) the health of the emperor,\nabove and below. Unlike the altar of Peace, no remains of this\none have ever been found and its location remains a mystery.",
            "Comparing the Altar of Salus on Domitian s As of 85\nto the fa ade of the Altar of Peace photographed inside its\nmagnificent sun-drenched new housing we can see many\nsimilarities. There is a central, wide door. Stairs lead up to it.\nIt is obviously open to the heavens, so the smoke of sacrifice\ncould make its intended impression on the gods. Of course\nnearly a century had passed between the two, so there are\ndifferences. In the Altar of Salus the door is much wider\nleaving less room for a sculptural programme. The steps are\nfull width on the newer building.",
