News of the heavy and brutal fighting on the\nWestern Front trickled back to Britain slowly and reports\nof heavy losses began to surface. Within the first month\nof war more than 10,000 men were reported wounded,\nmissing in action or killed. Families began to think of\ntheir loved ones overseas and how they could spread a\nlittle comfort and good cheer for the holiday season. A\nbrisk trade in gifts developed within the trenches with gift\nhampers from Fortnum s, a luxury retailer, fetching as\nhigh as 5 guineas.

She became concerned about the sprits and\nwelfare of the British Expeditionary Force troops with\nthe upcoming Christmas season. In an act of pure charity\nand young naivety, Princess Mary stated she wanted to\nprovide a personal gift to each soldier and sailor to be paid\ndirectly out of her personal royal allowance. When this\nwas deemed impracticable, she formed a committee of the\ngreat and good and lent her name to the public charitable\nappeal that would endeavour to raise the money necessary\nto ensure Mary s wish would become a reality.",

At one point\nIrving writes:  And when St. Nicholas had smoked his pipe,\nhe twisted it in his hatband, and laying his finger beside his\nnose gave the astonished Van Kortlandt a very significant\nlook; then mounting his wagon he returned over the tree\ntops and disappeared.

Intriguingly, the poem\nwas published anonymously in the Troy,\nNew York, Sentinel on December 23,\n1823, having been sent there by a friend\nbecause Moore felt that, as a professor and\nbiblical scholar, it was beneath his dignity\nto have his name associated with such a\nfrivolous composition.

Nast s inspiration for how Santa\nshould appear came from Moore s poem, read\nto the illiterate artist by his wife. Nast went on\nto produce a total of 76 Christmas engravings\nthat were signed and published over a 24-\nyear period. In addition to the imagery, Nast\nmade several other contributions to the Santa\ntradition: he established Santa as a citizen of\nthe world by placing his home at the North\nPole (Canadians may object, since the\nmagnetic north pole is in Canada); he gave\nSanta a workshop populated with elves; and\nsome even attribute the sending of letters to\nSanta as Nast s idea.",

            "This month s column features a coin\n| that was initially discovered",
            "by an astute collector, from   \nNova Scotia, back in February of\nthis year, and excellent photos\nwere posted online in the\nCanadian variety forum of\nCoin Community Family\n(CCF). So, the hunt was |\non and I recently found an\nexample; this coin provided\nan opportunity to closely\nexamine the reported doubled\ndie, occurring on a nickel\ndollar. The nickel dollar is no\nstranger to doubled die varieties,\nwith the 1968 nickel dollar Extra\nWaterlines and the 1974 nickel\ndollar Winnipeg Centennial Double\nYoke. Punch doubled coins\n(or, hub doubling in US\nnomenclature) have been\nhistorically popular with\ncollectors of decimal coinage. Typically, such coins are\nclassified as Doubled Die Obverse (DDO) or Doubled Die\nReverse (DDR).",
            "Last month, we examined a doubled die phenomenon\nthat only occurred in the dead centre of a 1964 one-cent\ncoin (limited pressure hub doubling). However, this 1971\nproof-like British Columbia nickel dollar doubled die has\nelements doubled over the entire reverse surface of the coin,\nfrom the centre of the devices to the legends and denticles\nnear the rim (Figure 1).",
            "In the nickel dollar strikes, including business strikes,\nproof-like and specimen strikes, machine doubling and die\ndeterioration doubling is commonly observed (cf., Stanton,\n2004). This occurs when the die is slightly loose in the\npress. When the coin is struck, the die twists ever so slightly\nas it is released. The result of machine doubling is a flat,\nshelf-like area, low to the fields of the design, which appears\nto differmg degrees as being doubled. Several examples of\nmore prominent machine doubling on the obverse, reverse\nor both sides, are listed in the 67\" edition of the Charlton\nCatalogue, in the nickel dollar variety section (Cross,\n2012). For the 1971 dollar, it appears that the entire die\nwas repunched with the second punch being slightly offset\nto the north (top) and slightly rotated clockwise. The offset",
            "/",
            "was not enough to notch the major devices of the\ndie but photomicrographs show that, while\nthe doubling can appear like machine\ndoubling over some parts of the\ncoin, multiple elements with acute\nangles demonstrate that this is\nunquestionably a doubled die\n(Figure 2).\nTo date, this doubled\ndie variety has been found\nby several collectors in a\nrelatively short amount of\ntime, but only in the proof-\nlike pliofilm coin sets from\n1971. It is unknown if this\nvariety was confined to a single\nworking die or to a working punch\n(which would have created several\ndies). There is no documented listing\nof a 1971 doubled die; this\ncoin would be classified as\nCH#1971 Rev-003 in the\nCharlton numbering system\n(not to be confused with Rev-002, which is machine\ndoubling of the reverse legend, also found in 1971 proof-\nlike strikes).",
            "Collectors have scrutinized the series of nickel dollars for\nmany years, given how easy it is to spot the doubled die, it\nis somewhat surprising that it has remained undocumented\nuntil now. This one should be an easier one to find, and it\nwill not cost you very much when you do find it in the wild,\nso grab your loupe and keep up the hunt!",

            "Jerry Remick and Serge Pelletier wrote the first\ncatalogue on the subject. As evident when you read the\nfull title: Canadian Trade Dollars: A Fascinating New\nField in Canadian Numismatics, their work was an\nintroduction to municipal trade dollars.",
            "Jerry Remick was a well-known numismatist,\nspecializing in British Commonwealth and other world\ncoins. He was a prolific researcher who wrote many\narticles and catalogues. Serge Pelletier\nwould later publish several catalogues\non Canadian trade dollars.",
            "While this was the first work\npublished on Canadian trade dollars,\nseveral articles had been published\nearlier. Many were announcements of\nnew issues rather than scholarly works\non the subject. Since they frequently\nappeared in the Canadian Token, the\nofficial publication of the Canadian\nAssociation of Token Collectors, it\nwas natural that the organization would\npublish Canadian Trade Dollars as their\nfirst monograph.",
            "A trade dollar is a token, issued by a\ncity or some other community entity, with\na face value that can be used as currency\nfor a limited time only. Usually it bears a\ndenomination of one dollar, but it could\nhave any value. These dollars are usually\nissued as fund raisers for festivals or\nother tourist events, or by community\norganizations such as the Lions Club\nor Kiwanis. While they can be used as\ncurrency in local businesses, most trade\ndollars are never used in trade, and end up\nas souvenirs or in collections.",
            "The book has everything about trade\ndollars that a novice collector would\nneed to know. It has a checklist of\ntrade-dollar issues in Canada, listed\nby municipality and by province.",

And several pages contain information about\nmintages, dies, mint marks, physical specifications, metallic\ncontent, and other technical information. The authors don't\nlimit themselves to metal issues; they also included paper\nscrip and wooden tokens.",
            "Remick would go on to write about other numismatic\nsubjects. Pelletier, on the other hand, would continue to\nwrite catalogues on Canadian trade dollars. His name\nwould become more closely associated with them than\nthat of any other numismatist. If you've ever consulted a\ntrade dollar catalogue, chances are it was written by Serge",

            "Egypt had always had a very distinctive\nE coinage. To begin with, the country was\nlate adopting coinage at all, the late",
            "period Pharaohs sticking stubbornly to the\nold barter system of their long past even as\nlate as the early 4\" century BC. But with\nAlexander s conquest of the country and\nthe foundation of the essentially Greek\ncity of Alexandria, Egypt needed to get on\nboard with the rest of her trading partners in the\nMediterranean and adopt a coinage. (Rome herself\nwas late getting into what was after all a Greek\ninvention, at least in the West). Under the\nPtolemaic successors of Alexander, Egypt s\nsilver coins followed the pattern of other\nHellenistic lands but their bronze coins\nwere among the largest and heaviest of any\ncoins ever made for general circulation.\nAfter the Roman conquest, Augustus made\nthe country an Imperial province under the\nemperor s control (as opposed to Senatorial\nprovinces) because of Rome s dependence on\nEgyptian wheat (referred to in many sources by its\nolder generic term corn). What followed was the\nadoption of yet another distinctive coinage\neasily seen as different from Roman\nImperial and, perhaps more importantly,\nfrom other provincial issues.",
            "The basic coin was the tetradrachm,\nwith all its subdivisions: the drachm and\nthe hemidrachm (drachm is pronounced\nlike dram). There are many smaller\ndenominations with names usually associated\nwith classical Greece (obols, dichalkons) and\na whole coinage of the Nomes (essentially\nEgyptian provinces) but the most commonly\nencountered by collectors are the two\nillustrated here.",
            "The smaller coin exhibits all\nthe characteristics of this unique\ndenomination, the Alexandrian\ntetradrachm. It is about the diameter of\nour 25-cent piece but is much thicker and of\ncourse heavier. Its material, while showing a\nsomewhat silvery appearance, is of a very much\ndebased silver (less than 50 percent and often much\nless) called billon a word thought to be derived from bullion.",
            "SS Sa aa The CN Journal",
            "Together with the thickness of the flan, these\ncoins are often referred to as  dumpy  in\nappearance, (not helped by their always\ncrude, though often charming, artwork);\nnonetheless, they have an avid following of\nloyal collectors who rush to their defence.\nThe first coin then, is a typical\nAlexandrian tetradrachm (often shortened\nto fet) struck in Nero s tenth year, 63-4.\nIt shows his portrait facing right, wearing\nthe radiate crown and surrounded by the Greek\ninscription: NEPO KAAY KAIZ TEP AY which\ntransposed into Latin becomes NERO CLAU\nCAES GER AVG (Nero Claudius Caesar\nGermanicus Augustus). There should be\nno intimidation factor in using the Greek\nalphabet, which is reproduced in all books\nfor collectors of these coins.\nThe coin s reverse has a portrait of Nero s\nwife Poppaea. Nero, after stealing her from\nOtho (then Governor of Lusitania, essentially\ntoday s Portugal), infamously kicked her to death\nwhile she was pregnant. Around is the legend:\nNONMNMAIA ZEBAZTE LI (Poppaea Sebaste or\nQueen Poppaea). LI is the date, Nero s tenth year.\nThe second coin is a large bronze, about\n35 mm in diameter (and likely equivalent\nto the Imperial sestertius). The flan has\nbeen cast, unlike imperial issues. Again it\n1s comparatively crude in fabric and in the\nlevel of artistry. Nonetheless, the portrait\nof Antoninus Pius is recognisable. This is a\ndrachm, % of the previous coin. Antoninus s\nportrait is laureate, draped and facing left.\nAround is ANTONINOZ ZEB ... KAI, the ellipsis\nbeing letters missing or off the flan. The\nreverse shows Neptune, god of the sea,\nwith his trident and holding a dolphin\nlooking seaward likely from the famed\nAlexandrian lighthouse, the Pharos,\ndedicated to him. LIA is the year 149.\nThese fascinating coins are no longer\na neglected branch of ancient coin\ncollecting. Best of all, they still won t break\nthe bank. Often displaying portraits of characters\nwho never appear on the regular Roman series, like\nPoppaea, they make a unique contribution to numismatics\nand the study of Classical history.",
