            "sy ALAN TUNG, #23446",
            "Introduction",
            "When I first saw the word\n Bitcoin  in a local news-\npaper article last year, I",
            "couldn't resist reading about it. Like a\nfly drawn to delicious garbage, I went\nfor the word  coin.  After reading the\narticle, my flame of curiosity initially\ngot smothered a little bit upon realizing\nthat Bitcoin was completely digital. It\nwas only a few months later, after chat-\nting with a close friend of mine who in-\nvests in Bitcoins that I decided to have\na closer look at this new form of cur-\nrency that is beginning to creep into our\ndaily lives   or at least into the papers.\nBitcoin: What's That?",
            "First off, what is a Bitcoin? Bitcoin is a\nform of electronic money that relies on\na network of peers to verify its exist-\nence (more on this later). Bitcoin was\ncreated in 2009 by Satoshi Nakamoto,\na mysterious man whose name itself is\na pseudonym (Wikipedia, 2014a).",
            "On the business side of things, you\ncan use Bitcoins as money. If the seller\naccepts Bitcoins, you can use Bitcoins\nlike the Canadian dollar, to pay for\nservices or goods such as coffee, eye-\nglasses or even cars, (Robinson, 2014;\nShaw, 2014). For you, transferring\nBitcoins to your recipient is kind of\nlike wiring money ( Bitcoin,  2014).\nPeople have an electronic account\ncalled a wallet that records the number\nof Bitcoins you have. From your wallet\napplication, all you have to do is type\nin the recipient's wallet address and the\nBitcoin amount, and then click send\n(fig. 1). Each transaction costs a small\nBitcoin fee to pay for the authentication\nprocess of the transaction.",
            "There are also Bitcoin exchanges,\nsuch as VirtEx, where Bitcoins can\nbe exchanged for other currencies\n( Virtex: Canadian Virtual Exchange, \n2014). Vancouver, BC, (my home-\ntown!) became the first place in the\nworld with an ATM machine that can\nconvert Bitcoins into Canadian money\nand vice versa (Shaw, 2013).",
            "The price of a Bitcoin is deter-\nmined by simple economics: supply\nand demand ( Bitcoin,  2014). If more\npeople want to use Bitcoins, then the\nvalue of Bitcoins goes up. If the op-\nposite happens   fewer people wanting\nBitcoins   then the value of Bitcoins\ndrops. A great example of this hap-\npened fairly recently; in 2013, China\ninitially did not impose any restric-\ntions on its citizens participation in\nthe Bitcoin system, resulting in many\nChinese nationals buying Bitcoins\n(Mullany, 2013). This increased the\ndemand for Bitcoins tremendously and\npushed the value of the Bitcoin well\nabove USD $1200. However, when the\ncentral government finally rejected the\nlegitimacy of the Bitcoin and banned\nthe Chinese banks from dealing with\nit, demand for Bitcoins dropped,\ncausing the value of a Bitcoin to dive\nbelow USD $600.",

            "Varieties in the Canadian large\n\\ / cent series are abundant. Find-\ning a pristine large cent struck\nas intended by the engraver can be\ntougher than finding a coin with-\nout some kind of die or striking var-\niety. Much attention has been paid\nto the Victorian series of large cents,\nwith the popularity surging in recent\nyears thanks to the 65\" Edition of the\nA Charlton Standard Catalogue Can-\nadian Coins Volume One: Numismatic\nIssues (Cross, 2010), which specific-\nally focused on that series (1.e., 1858 \n1901). Most recently, Professional\nCoin Grading Service (PCGS) has\nexpanded its registry set of Canadian\nVictorian Cents to include several of\nthe most popular 1859 reverse var-\nieties. Completing a PCGS registry set\nof Victorian cents, with varieties, has\nsuddenly become more challenging, re-\nquiring not only the elusive 1859 brass\ncent, but also double-punched varia-\ntions #1 through #5, 9 over inverted 9,\nand the triple-punched 9. Undoubtedly,\nthis will affect demand for premium\nexamples, as registry set players tend to\nstrive to 100% completion of sets. Vic-\ntorian cent varieties are now at a high\npoint, with respect to popularity in the\nCanadian collecting community.\nVarieties in the Edward VII and\nGeorge V series of large cents have\nseen much less attention, despite\nsome specific varieties being almost\nas elusive to find as some Victorian\nexamples. When it comes to Can-\nadian large cent varieties from 1901\nto 1920, Jack Griffin was the pioneer\nwho first discovered and documented\nmany varieties (2010). The coin fea-",
            "tured this month is the 1909 Recut 1\n(Griffin Gr-378, R3). I have found this\nvariety to be fairly easy to spot in mint\nstate and in circulated coins of higher\ngrade (EF or better). At first glance,\none might assume that the doubling of\nthe 1 is the result of machine doubling,\nas it does have a step-like effect (Stan-\nton, 2010). But, closer examination\nshows that the offsets have a notch-like\neffect at the edges of the digit (fig. 1\npage 181), and on looking further, the\ncoin shows doubling of the first 9 of the\ndate, with this doubling in the opposite\ndirection (fig. 2 page 182), ruling out\nmachine doubling. Note that all of the\nfirst 9s, in cents struck in 1909, show\nthe same doubling, which was probably\nfrom the hub. Doubling on the top of\nthe E in ONE and the top of the T (and\nleft bottom serif) in CENT also came\nfrom the hub.",
            "Another obvious feature is the dif-\nference between the two 9s of the date.\nThe first 9 is slender and has a hook at\nthe knob; the second 9 is larger, with a\nrounded knob. The marked difference\nin the two 9s makes this date quite in-\nteresting (fig. 3 page 182). Hans Zoell\n(1965) did not go into as much detail\nas Griffin did with the Edward VII ser-\nies, but called all 1909 cents with the\nsecond, larger 9 as  large date  and as-\nsigned them as X31d in his 1965 cata-\nlogue. Griffin (2010) also documented\na variety of gap differences between\nthe 0 and the last 9.",
            "Griffin noted that the 1909 cents\nused the same hub as the 1908 cents\nfor the first 3 digits, so there are also\n1908 cents that have the same stepped\n1 as seen in Figure 1. Any digit that had",
