Our long\nrelationship with Webco had essentially\nbuffered us from steady price increases\nby the industry. In addition to new\nprinting costs, a significant increase\ncame with the higher post-production\nadd-ons, like stuffing and mailing\nenvelopes, which had previously been\nincluded in our deal with the Webco\nfacility. We also needed to account for\nincreased postage costs when postal\nrates increase in 2015.

            "At that time colourized\ncoins were new; the RCM had\nintroduced its first such coin in\n2000. The same year, it brought out\nthe first in a series of colourized\n25-cent coins for Canada, using red\nto enhance the design.",
            "The first Canadian Christmas\ncoin followed that established\npattern. A solid nickel planchet was\nstruck with a traditional image of\nSanta Claus, his signature suit\nfinished in red.",
            "The coin was not universally\naccepted, and was criticized by\nnumismatic purists. Nonetheless, it\nwas a financial success, with a final\nmintage of 63,000 coins. Nearly 50\npercent more than the mintage of that\nyear s Canada Day coin.",
            "The series continued for several\nyears, with a selection of festive images.\nIn 2005, the RCM added a second\ncolour, being green holly leaves to go\nwith a red stocking containing a teddy\nbear. The 2006 design showed Santa s\nsleigh, and a Christmas tree appeared\non the 2007 coin. In 2008, as the RCM\nexperimented with full colour, the coin\nfeatured a photographic rendering of a\nlive action Santa. The final two coins in\nthe series, 2009 and 2010, showed full\ncolour cartoon-style images.",
            "For the next two years, the RCM\nproduced special issue 25-cent coins\nfor the gift sets, but abandoned\ncolour and went for Uncirculated\nnickel coins. The 2011 series had a\nsnowflake pattern on the holiday set.\nIn 2012, no holiday set was issued.",

But, in more serious vein, a\nportrait in oils of my sister was hung\nin the Royal Academy, where he also\nhad landscapes and etchings accepted.\nIn his studio I remember admiring a\nbeautifully contrived wooden model of\nan ancient man-of-war, accurate to the\nlast detail, and one December, a huge\nrepresentation of the Nativity Scene cut\nand painted for seasonal celebrations in\nCanterbury Cathedral.\n"

Many troops\nwanted to observe the enemy up-close\nand first hand to see if he was as bad as\npropaganda was saying. It was difficult\nfor many of the troops to reject the\nsocial norms and manners of the times.\nAt the front many soldiers retained\na degree of measured respect for the\nenemy as gentlemen. This proximity\ndid lead to temporary agreements not to\nfire and impromptu truces would occur.\nDuring these pauses in the hostility,\nsoldiers would use the time to retrieve\nthe bodies of fellow combatants who\nhad fallen and perished within the no-\nman s land zone and to give these poor\nsouls a proper burial. Often once this\ndeed was done, the opponents would\ninevitably begin talking to one another.\nThe actual degree of fraternization\nbetween the sides is not documented\nbut was apparently relatively common\nduring this initial stage of the war.\n"

This material was reviewed\nin a special meeting of the executive\ncalled in late November. At that time\nwe determined that the cost increases\nhad the side-effect of putting us on\nequal footing with other size formats.\nIt was unanimously agreed that we\nwould take the opportunity to move\nThe CN Journal to the next level by\nadopting a new larger format.",
            "As Bret Evans has mentioned\nin his President s message column,\nstarting with January/February 2015,\nwe will be producing the Journal as a\n48-page, larger-size (8-1/8 x 10-3/4\ninch) magazine. This will give us the\nopportunity to deliver a more visually\nappealing Journal.",
            "The increased size will mean a\nreduction in frequency from ten issues a\nyear to eight, however, the larger pages\nwill provide more room for articles, and\nmore room for layout and presentation\nwhich, besides being more esthetically\npleasing, will give us the opportunity\nto enhance the educational value by\nprinting larger more detailed images of\nfull-size numismatic material.",
            "We sincerely hope that this new\nformat will enhance your enjoyment\nof your Journal as we move together\ninto the future.",
            "Once again, I would like to take\nthis opportunity to approach all RCNA\nmembers with a request that each of\nyou take the opportunity to contribute\nto our new Journal by submitting one\nor two articles. We look forward to your\nsubmissions and welcome them. I think\nyou will find the exercise quite fulfilling.\nWe would be glad to help!",
            "I would also like to take this\nopportunity to wish you and yours a\nhealthy and prosperous New Year. And,\nI hope, the opportunities to enjoy your\nhobby are boundless in 2015.",
