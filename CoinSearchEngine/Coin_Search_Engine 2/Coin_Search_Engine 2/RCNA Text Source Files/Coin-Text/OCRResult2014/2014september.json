All of the cards I have are\nwith an encapsulated 25-cent coin with\ncolouring of the maple leaf emblem.\nAll but three of the coins have\nVancouver 2010 on the Reverse, and\non their Obverse, the date of issue as\nwell as the symbol for the Olympic or\nParalympic Games. The three that do\nnot are the Top Ten Canadian Olympic\nWinter Moments coins.\n   The number 1 of 15 collector\ncard is the 2007 dated Vancouver\n2010 Curling coin (2007/2010).\n  Number 2 the Ice Hockey coin\ndated 2007/2010.\n   Number 3 the Wheelchair\nCurling coin dated 2007/2010.\n   Number 4 the Biathlon coin\ndated 2007/2010.\n   The first released Alpine Skiing\nNumber 5 card, sold at Petro\nCanada locations, has the\nincorrectly dated 2008/2010\nmule-coin. After the date error\ndiscovery, the later released\nNumber 5 card, sold by the\nMint, has the correctly dated\n2007/2010 replacement coin.\n   Number 6 the Snowboarding\ncoin, the first officially with the\n2008/2010 dates.",
