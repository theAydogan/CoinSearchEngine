This\nunintentional rotation can occur\neither because the technician, who\nhad set up the press made an error in\nalignment when he tightened down\nthe dies, or one or both of the\ndies were not held rigid in the\nchuck and were allowed to\nrotate during the operation\nof the press.\nAs you probably\nknow, the correct\norientation between the\ntwo dies differs from\ncountry to country or\nwithin certain date ranges\nfor a particular country.\nFor modern coins, this will\nbe either Medal Orientation \nwhen the obverse and reverse\nare both in an upright position, or\nCoinage Orientation when the reverse\nis aligned 180  from the obverse.",

            "The amount of unintentional\nrotation will play a significant role in\nthe perceived collectability of the error.\nSmall rotations of 10 15  or less are\nrelatively common on older coins,\nmore so in the Victorian series coins,\nand are typically not very collectable\nother than as oddities. Rotations of\n45-90  are more collectable and\ngain more of a premium.
