Despite the level of interest,\nsome avoid the series due to economic\nreasons; however, their high premiums\nare not solely due to low supply (mint-\nage figures) but also to high demand\non the collector markets.  Why the\nintense level of excitement around the\nCarson City (CC) mintmark?  some\nindividuals may ponder. For many, in-\ncluding myself, the appeal of the CC\nmintmark can partially be credited to\nits distinction as the sole two-lettered\nmintmark. Its status as the most famous\nof the now-defunct United States\nbranch mints in addition to its popular-\nity inflated by many numismatic media\noutlets elevate its demand. Some rem-\niniscent collectors may even view it as\na loving memory of the bygone era of\nthe Old West. Additionally, as this mint\nhas produced very few coins in only\neight denominations, it is a challenging\nbut fun task to obtain a denomination\ndate set. There is a reason for every- |\none to collect CC coins, including\nhistory buffs, treasure hunters,\nnumismatic speculators,\nthe average collector, and\neveryone in between.\nIntroducing the\nCarson City Mint's\nHistory\nNevada was admitted\ninto the Union in 1864\nto garner  vast mineral\nwealth  through the loyalty\nof the former territory dur-",

Due to\nthe large mineral deposits in the area,\nthis now-famous branch mint was es-\ntablished in the Nevada state capital of\nCarson City in 1870, several years after\nits Congressional approval in 1863.\nThe lengthy delay was due to political\nand financial obstacles with the federal\ngovernment. The small branch mint\nwas created because mine owners in\nNevada did not want to ship their bul-\nlion  over the Sierra Nevada Moun-\ntains to the United States Mint at San\nFrancisco,  since it was a difficult and\ndangerous journey (Lange 107).",

            "For gold denominations, their mint-\nage figures have always been low due\nto their lack of circulation in everyday\ncommerce and the US dollar s high\npurchasing power at the time.
