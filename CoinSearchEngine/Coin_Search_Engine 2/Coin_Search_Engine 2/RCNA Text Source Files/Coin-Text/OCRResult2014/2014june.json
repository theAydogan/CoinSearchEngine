            "At what point, does a mint-\nAve feature cease to be-\ncome a variety, and is better\nclassified as a post-strike finish fea-\nture? The 25-cent coin strikes, for the\nhockey sets of 2007 and the occasion\nsets from 2007 to 2010, are all struck\nwith the same die each year. It is only\nthe painted design on the finished\ncoin, which differentiates the various\nnon-circulated legal tender products.\nSince the Royal Canadian Mint placed\nthat painted finish on the coin, after it\nwas struck, does that constitute a true\nvariety? Once the painted design on\nthese coins is gone   after a bath in a\nsolvent (under controlled conditions)\n the  variety  disappears. Purists of the\nhobby may not think of these as var-\nieties, but these coins are listed individ-\nually (as part of sets) in Cross (2013).\nHowever, coins struck with spe-\ncially treated dies, such as the 1937\nmirror and matte-finish specimen\nsets, or coins struck with freshly\ntreated dies, producing a cameo effect",
            "(Hermesh, 1997), are considered to be\nworthy of a comment from Canadian\nthird party grading companies, due\nto the different finish imparted on the\ndevices of the coin. Coins that have a\nvery heavy contrast between the frosty\ndevices and mirrored fields, have con-\nsiderable eye appeal and often com-\nmand a heavy premium over other\nproof-like strikes with mirrored fields\nand devices.",
            "Another type of finish on proof-like\n1-cent coins has been occasionally\nobserved by astute collectors, but for\nthe most part, has gone unnoticed by\nthe numismatic community. On 1-cent\ncoins in the pliofilm proof-like sets\nfrom 1962 to 1967 examples can be\nfound in two distinctly visible finishes,\ngiving them either a matte or mirror\nappearance.

Not all\nof the proof-like sets have the treated\ncents; other cents have mirrored fields,\ncomplete with die\npolish marks in the\nfields (fig. 2B).

In 1901 John Craig\nEaton took control and so began\nthe next generation of Eaton s.\nTimothy Eaton died of pneu-\nmonia on January 31, 1907. He\nleft an estate of more than five\nmillion dollars.\nEaton s continued dur-\ning the century, but eventually\nfailed and filed for bankruptcy\nin August 1999. Its last surviving\nstore closed its doors February 26,\n2002.\nAuthors Note:\nInterestingly Timothy Eaton was born\nand raised 27 miles (43 kilometres)\naway from my grandparents in Ireland,\nand he would later come to Canada\nand clerk in Glen Williams just 2\nmiles (2.7 kilometres) from my\nchildhood home of George-\ntown, Ontario. My mother\nworked for Eaton s in Toronto\nin the 1940s as did many\nother Irish folk.

            "Two Wonderful Eaton's Stories\nIn Winnipeg, Eaton s stores would always\nround off their prices to the nearest nickel.\nAs a result Manitoba customers never had\na use for the one-cent coin. In Toronto\nit was common practice to end pricing\nin a seven, eight or nine cents. The\nopening of the new Winnipeg Eaton s\nstore in July 1905 would change the\nManitoba shopping experience forever.\nFor its grand opening Eaton s officials\n(without forethought) had ordered from\nOttawa $500 in cents, or  coppers  as they\nwere known then. In the beginning Winnipeg\nshoppers, not knowing what to do with the seem-\ningly unwanted  change  (cents), left them on\nthe counter or placed them in the charity\nboxes on the counters. Newspapers were\nsold on the street for a nickel (rounded\noff), so inside their door Eaton s began\nselling newspapers for two cents. The\nshopping public soon caught on and the\nnewsagents got their first taste of the\nEaton effect!",
            "The second story is from the book\nInk On My Fingers by Herbert Cranston,\nthe son of token manufacturer J.K. Cran-\nston of Galt. Herbert worked for the Toronto\nStar for many years and was the editor of the Star\nWeekly Magazine. In the 1920s one of the col-\numnists was Charlie Vining who was put-\nting together a story on the suspiciousness\nof native Torontonians. Cranston got an\nidea and went to the Canadian Bank\nof Commerce to obtain a $1000 bill.\nThese large bills were not in circula-\ntion and were only used by banks\nsettling daily clearing transactions.\nCranston then got Ving and another re-\nporter Greg Clark to take the $1000 bill\nup Yonge Street to the retail section and\ntry to purchase something with the bill. The\nfirst shop the reporters went in\nwas a haberdashers shop. They\npicked out some ties and after\nthe clerk wrapped them up and",

            "The second was minted in 82 BC by\nthe moneyer Lucius Manlius Tor-\nquatus. He was an official known as a\nProquaestor (an official in charge of the\nmint whose term had been prorogued,\nor extended) toward the end of Sulla s\ncareer (he died in 79 BC). On the ob-\nverse is a head of Roma with L MANLI\nPROQ around. The reverse depicts his\nRoman triumph over Mithradates VI\n(for a related coin see Nummus Matrix\n7:  Sulla in Athens: A Dictator in the\nSeat of Democracy ) and shows Sulla\n(a weak strike has rendered him head-\nless) in his quadriga moving slowly\nright. Beneath is LSVLLAIM.\nTriumphant through his life, un-\ndoubtedly all the while wearing the\nring, Sulla laid the groundwork for\nthe  might is right  philosophy that\neventually turned the republic into the\nRoman Empire.\nJames R.

Though I had renewed my\ninterest in coin collecting a few years\nprior, and was keenly interested in ac-\nquiring, I had not been as keenly inter-\nested in organizing. My purchases were\nnot housed in a totally random fashion.\nOlder coins were kept in a small box,\nnewer coins went in the big box, the\ntime periods of  old  and  new  being\nonly loosely defined. These boxes had\nthe pleasing appearance of a hoard of\nViking plunder. However, I am not a\nNorse raider (I checked my Facebook\nprofile). If I aspired to ever be a ser-\nious member of the numismatic breed,\nsomething would have to be done.",
            "As I saw it, there were two options.\nOption #1; Do nothing. This held a\ncertain appeal, as it required the least\nexertion. Option #2; Sort and organ-\nize. After due deliberation, I concluded\nthat this second option offered the best\nchance for me to form a coherent coin\ncollection. And, I might discover I ac-\ncidently owned something valuable.",
            "Armed with a pile of used coin cata-\nlogues I had acquired at club auctions,\nstacks of 2x2 holders of various sizes,\nand a magnifying glass the diameter\nof which would have made Sherlock\nHolmes jealous, I dug in. I quickly dis-\ncovered J had an affinity for common\nEnglish pennies dated 1935, and may\nin fact have inadvertently cornered the\nworld market for that year type.

            "Now my entire coin collection is in a\nsingle box.  a very heavy box. As I see\nit, my collection growth is limited to\nthe weight I can lift.
