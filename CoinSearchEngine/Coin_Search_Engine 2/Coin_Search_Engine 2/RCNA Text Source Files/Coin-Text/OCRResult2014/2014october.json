At that time the\ngaol would have been located across the\nstreet from Perrin s business. J. L.

Sometimes re-strikes in\nthe original design have edge numbers\nand sometimes they do not, the former\nbeing part of a run created around the\ntime of the centennial of the War of\n1812 (as indicated in a note from 1916\nin the Wyon firms  manuscript register\nof dies in the collection of the British\nMuseum). Almost none of the re-strikes\nhave the suspension ring on them that\nthe originals had, but at least one of the\nnumbered re-strikes from the 1910s has\nappeared on eBay with such an addition\n(although the ring on the eBay item\nwas quite different from the one on the\noriginal medal that I examined).",

The answer\nlies in the work of the historian Cassius\nDio whose 80 volume Roman History\n(actually 11 modern small format books\nin the Loeb Classical Library readily\navailable online) draw to a close just\none year after in 229. Dio was a Roman\nsenator in the time of Severus Alexander\nand describes a very dangerous situation\nindeed. The Praetorian Prefect Ulpian,\nby all accounts a cruel and heartless",

In fact\nnumismatics is definitely one way in\nwhich you can become engaged with\nhistory. In many ways numismatic\nitems are themselves little time\ncapsules. I know that researching items\nthat I have acquired has brought me\ncloser to the events of the time and\nplace that the coin or medal was issued,\nand vice-versa. Researching the item in\nyour hand can give you a picture of just\nhow much we know, or don't know for\nthat matter, of the times surrounding it.\nThere are many examples of this in\nthis issue. For example, James Bakes\ntalks about the rare medallion he has\nacquired. In researching it, however he\nis left with more questions than he can\nanswer.

The uncovering and\nsubsequent acquisition of two of\nthe three surviving examples of\nthe second version of the Upper\nCanada Preserved medals 1s in itself\nof historical significance. The fact\nthat the person who kept them for\nprosperity, was William Allen adds\nto this amazing provenance. Allen, a\nYork (Toronto) shop keeper in 1797,\nwas the same man who negotiated the\nterms of surrender with the invading\nAmerican forces when York was\ncaptured during the War of 1812.
