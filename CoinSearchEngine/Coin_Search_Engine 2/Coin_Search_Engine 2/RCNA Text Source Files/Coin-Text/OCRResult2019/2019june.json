           "Classifying rare Canadian coins\nby Brian Cornwell, FRCNA LM #229 (August, 1985)",
        "Canada s rarest or  key date  decimal coins can easily\nbe identified by reading through a pricing catalogue and\nselecting the dates in each series that have the highest\nprice levels. This requires no special numismatic skill or\nknowledge. However, such pricing data will only help to\nsuggest a relative rather than absolute measure of a coin s\ndegree of rarity. It would not answer the question  How\nmany examples of a particular coin exist in a specific\ngrade or higher?  Catalogue prices also offer few clues\nas to those coins which knowledgeable rare-coin people\nconsider to he  sleepers.  Sometimes getting at this latter\ninformation can be difficult. Many specialists are reluctant\nto publicize rarity data on these  sleepers  as long as they\nare able to buy them from the uninformed for prices far\nbelow their true worth and sell them to those who know\nvalue for a handsome profit. The new rare-coin collector\nor investor has little factual rarity data available for study\nbefore making rare-coin purchases. What is available seems\nlimited to one s own personal experiences or accepting\nthe  gut  feel of the few willing to assist. The quality or\naccuracy of the information from this latter source varies\nwidely depending on whose  gut  is doing the talking.\nThis particular study is aimed at the uncirculated grades\nof Canada s  key date  and  sleeper date  coins. These\ncoins appear so infrequently in such high grades at public\nauctions that the typical consumer considers them to be\nnon-existent. The few that do transact from time to time\nusually do so by private treaty sale and often both the\nevent and the price paid remain private with the buyer and\nseller. This is unfortunate because it reinforces the general\ncollector s and dealer s impression that they are all simply\n tough  and they remain totally unaware of the widely\nvarying degrees of condition rarity that can exist depending\non the date and the grade.",

The results of\nthe study are expected to compare favourably to\nindustry-wide consensus once such is developed.",
        "(c) The study was limited only to those coins that are\nbusiness strikes; i.e., proofs and specimens were\nexcluded. Furthermore, the survey encompassed only\nthose coins in the public domain of the collector-\ndealer-investor. Coins belonging to museums were\nexcluded.",

In this respect, 75 percent\nof all coins listed here are just that rare in MS-65\nor higher grades and about 25 percent are\nsimilarly rare in basic MS-60 or better!\n(b) Unfortunately these results do not\nindicate the marketplace availability\nof these coins. As a general\nguideline, any item ranked as\nan R-8 will probably appear\nsomewhere in the market once\nevery 3 5 years; an R-7 will\nappear once each 24 months or so;\nand, an R-6 probably a few times\nevery 24 months.\n(c) Table II is a ranking of each\nof these  key date  coins in basic\nuncirculated MS-60 condition or\nbetter condition. The amount shown in\nparentheses following each date is the current\nmarket retail price for that coin in MS-60\ncondition. Compare these prices to those\nof other coins of the same denomination\nand rarity group to get some clues as\nto those that are potential  sleepers. \n_ Note that the most expensive items\nare not necessarily the rarest coins\nin uncirculated or higher grades.",

            "In 1985, the Regina Coin Club sponsored a day-long",
            "symposium as part of the Canadian Numismatic\nAssociation s annual convention. The theme was\nresearch into the numismatics of North America. Many\nnumismatic luminaries were involved. Robert C. Willey\npresented a paper on the North West Canada medal of 1885.\nSanford Durst discussed domestic and foreign coinage\ncirculating in colonial America. And Chris Faulkner\nexamined the known specimens of the Breton 999 token.\nThis event was held in addition to the educational\nforum that the CNA has held every year and continues\nto hold at its conventions to this day. While the usual\nforum provided information for collectors in general, the\nsymposium was intended to highlight the\nimportance of research and to encourage\nfurther numismatic scholarship among\nyounger collectors. In fact, the event ended\nwith a general discussion, involving all\nthe speakers, about the techniques and\nimportance of research in numismatics.\nA companion publication for the event,\nAspects of the Numismatics of North\nAmerica, was published the following\nyear. It included all the papers read at the\nsymposium plus a few that were not included\nbecause of time restraints. As with the\nsymposium, the book focused on research.\nThe very first paper was  The Current Status\nof Numismatic Research and Literature in\nNorth America.  In it, Robert C. Willey, Q.\nDavid Bowers, and C. Hubbard discussed\nresearch under way and needed in Canadian,\nUS, and Mexican numismatics.\nWhile the scope was the numismatics of\nNorth America, most of the papers focused\non Canada. R. C. Willey, in his book review\npublished in The Canadian Numismatic\nJournal, offered justification for this by\npointing out that very little numismatic\nresearch had been published in Canada for\ntwo generations, and this work helped to\nreduce the shortfall.\nBut some of the papers did cover non-\nCanadian topics. One, written by J. E.\nStorer was an overview of the coinage of\nMexico. And Maurice Cormier discussed\nthe effects of ancient coinage in his paper",

The most dramatic change from the information contained\nin the above article is certainly the development of third party\ngrading services, and the general availability of their continuously\nupgraded population reports. The care that needs to be taken in\nassessing the data in these third party grading reports was discussed\nin my first article in this series. However, it is quite evident that the\navailability of this information has now made somewhat obsolete\nthe very difficult task, described in the article as being the only\nmethod available at the time, of assessing absolute and condition\nrarity of any coin and grade by surveying knowledgeable collectors\nand dealers. More, and presumably more accurate, information on\nrarity is now readily available from the third party grading service\npopulation reports.",

Within the last 20 years, sales\nof major collections like the Belzberg, Canadiana and Mason\ncollections, by contrast, did not significantly change coin rarity,\nor rare coin numbers, because they were largely formed more\nrecently, with coins that were previously third party graded\nand thus already known to the collecting public. The release\nof  hoards  of certain coins has also changed the rarity of some\ncoins previously thought to be excessively, extremely, or very, rare.",

            "Ihave attempted, below, the task of updating the chart on Canadian\ncoin rarity as produced in the 1985 article. Instead of using the\nSheldon rarity scale used in the 1985 article, I elected to use the\nactual numbers from the third party grading population reports\nas shown on the PCGS website in April 2019, and then to relate\nthose numbers to the Sheldon rarity rating scale. I decided to use\nthis information because it is available on this website, and updated\nregularly. I have not attempted to factor in any additional information\nfrom the population reports of other grading services. I concluded\nthat it would be impossible to determine where there is duplication,\nbecause a rare com may have been sent in for grading to more than\none grading service. Any additional rare coins not showing up in the\nPCGS population report are probably at least offset in any event\nby coins that have been submitted to PCGS more than once for\nregrading, and thus are duplicated in the PCGS population report.\nThe significant point here is that these numbers are representative\nonly of coins currently in the PCGS population report, and should not\nbe taken as definitive numbers for any rare coins.",
            "It was with much trepidation that I considered attempting to update\nthe very limited valuation information for certain rare coins at various",
            "rarity ratings shown in the 1985 article. If anything, transaction pricing information on truly rare coins seems to have gone\neven more  underground  in the last 34 years. Important coins most often sell by private treaty between collectors, or\nbetween a collector and a dealer, with the purchasing dealer likewise disposing of the coin to another collector by another\nprivate treaty transaction. One has to be the actual buyer, or very close to the market, to dig out the pricing information on",
            "these transactions.",
            "Certainly, major collections, and important single rare coms, have\nbeen sold over the last 15 years by public auction, and information\nfrom these auctions is important. However, it is equally important to\nunderstand the circumstances of these auctions before coming to any\nhard conclusions on valuations. A single coin in a public auction may\nsell for more, or less, than like coins, depending on the eye appeal\n(either good or bad) of the item, and the exposure that the auction\nin question receives in the general collecting community. Large\ncollections sold at auction can also suffer from  funds exhaustion, \nas bidding collectors and dealers run out of money near the end of a\nsignificant auction, and important coins  slip through the cracks.  The\nsale of very important Newfoundland coins at the end of the Norweb\nauction in Baltimore in 1996 comes to mind here. The opposite can\noccur when collectors and dealers appear at a highly-anticipated\nauction and bid certain coms well above predicted values. The third\nPittman sale in Chicago in 1999, and the Landon sale in Toronto in\n2015, appear to me to be representative of this type of auction sale.",

            "Commentary on 5 Cents:",
            "If we follow the definition at the end of the Cornwell\narticle that  very rare  means that 30 or fewer examples\nof the coin exist, the only 5 cents on the list that merit the\ndefinition of  very rare  in mint state (MS-60 or higher) are\nthe 1884, 1875H, 1883H and 1921 (with the rarest being\nthe 1884), and no 5 cents rates as  extremely rare  (10 or\nfewer examples graded) or excessively rare  (3 or fewer\nexamples graded) in mint state.",
            "If we then consider choice mint state status (MS-63 or\nhigher), the 1884, 1900 round 0, 1875H, 1883H, 1921 and\n1925 5 cents, make it into the list of  very rare  in choice\nmint state, with the 1884 again being the most difficult of\nthis group, and the only date to rate  extremely rare  in\nchoice mint state.",
            "In the gem mint state category (MS-65 or better), all\nthe Victoria 5 cents, including the 1900 type coin, fall\nin the  very rare  category, so every Victoria 5 cents\nin gem mint state should be considered  very rare. \nAlso in the  very rare  category of gem mint state 5\ncents are the 1903, 1904 and 1909 in the Edward VII\nseries, along with 1921, 1915, 1926 and 1933 in the\nGeorge V series. The PCGS population reports show,\nas well, the 5 cents of 1903H, 1905 and 1906 as  very\nrare  in gem mint state, although not identified in\n1985 as being rare coins, along with, surprisingly, the\n1912 and 1918. Those five dates: 1903H, 1905, 1906,\n1912 and 1918, based on the PCGS information,\nmight be considered sleeper dates in gem mint state.",
            "All of these coins remain  very rare  in gem mint state\nin spite of the volume of very high-grade later Victoria\nand Edward 5 cents that became available in 2015 through\nthe auction sale of the Landon hoard, which contained\ncoins mainly dated 1887-1917, and had considerably more\n5 cents in the hoard than other silver coins.",
            "All of the Victoria dates in gem mint state remain at the\n extremely rare  level (10 or fewer examples), except for\nmost of the later dates (1890, 1891, 1892, 1893, 1896, 1898,\n1899, 1900 and 1901). These are no longer  extremely rare \nin gem mint state, most likely due to the impact of the Landon\nhoard s release on these dates. None of the Edward dates are\n extremely rare  in gem mint state. In the George V silver\nseries only the 1921 rates. At the  excessively rare  level\nin gem mint state (3 or fewer examples), the list narrows to\nthe 1872H, 1875H, 1884 and 1887 from the Victoria series,\nwith none of the Edward dates or the George V dates being\n excessively rare , including the 1921.",
            "Also somewhat interesting is that every single George V\nnickel 5 cents, other than 1922 (probably saved because it\nis the first year of the new 5-cent design), shows a number\nfor graded coins in gem mint state fewer than 30, meaning\nthat every one of these coins in gem mint state should\nbe considered  very rare.  But I think every collector of\nGeorge V nickel 5 cents already knows just how hard these\ncoins are to find in MS-65 or better.",
            "It should be noted that the above analysis does not take\ninto account the numerous over-date and date punching\nvarieties that are now being recognised. This is partly\nbecause these varieties were not formally recognised at\nthe time of the 1985 article now being compared, and\npartly because it is anticipated that the rarity of these\nvarieties has yet to be determined accurately by the third\nparty grading service population reports (it is suspected\nthat many of these varieties are still in grading holders\nthat do not attribute the variety).",
            "What summary conclusions might we draw from the\nabove analysis? Perhaps that:",
            "1) The 1884 remains (is) the rarest of the Canadian\n5 cents;",
            "2) All Victoria 5 cents are  very rare  in gem mint\nstate, and all dates before 1890 are also  extremely\nrare  in gem mint state;",
            "3) In the Edward series, the 1903H, 1905 and 1906\nare probably a little under-rated in gem mint state;",
            "4) The 1921 is clearly a rare coin, but no rarer than a\nnumber of the Victoria dates, which price out much\nless expensively at mint state grade levels. Also in\nthe George V series, the 1912 and the 1918 appear\nto be under-appreciated at the gem mint state level;",
            "5) All George V nickel 5 cents are  very rare  in gem\nmint state, except the 1922.",
